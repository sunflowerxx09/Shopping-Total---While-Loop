***
A shop is running a promotion today! 
If an item's price is an odd number, 
you get that item for free! You use 
a list to store the prices of all 
items in the shopping cart. The 
given code uses a while loop to 
iterate over the list, calculates 
the price of all the items in the 
list, and output the result. Change 
the code to skip the odd prices, 
calculate the sum of only the even 
prices and output the result.

>>>
items = [23, 555, 666, 123, 128, 4242, 990]

while True:
   if n%2==0:
      num = items[n]
      total += num
      print(total)
   else:
      print('')
